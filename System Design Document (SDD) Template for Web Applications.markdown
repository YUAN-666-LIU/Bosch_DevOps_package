# System Design Document (SDD) Template for Web Applications
1. Instructions
This tutorial will guide you through the basic steps of System Design Document, so you can directly work with your crew without hearting your brain.

Use Word online document to write this SDD.

your teammates are able to comment in the Doc.

2. Template
2.1. Abstract
This section briefly introduces the purpose, scope, and background of the design document. It may include a description of the problem or needs being addressed and the overall objectives of the project.

2.2. System Overview
In this section, provide a high-level overview of the system, including its main components, functionalities, and how it interacts with other systems.

2.3. System Architecture and Components (better to visualize it)
The core part of the document, detailing the system's architecture and each component. This includes data flow diagrams, component interactions, interface definitions, and detailed explanations of internal modules.

2.4. Data Design
If the system involves data storage and processing, this section describes the data model, database design, and data processing logic.

2.5. API
Features of each API.

2.6. Milestones
A list of measurable checkpoints, so your PM and your manager’s manager can skim it and know roughly when different parts of the project will be done. I encourage you to break the project down into major user-facing milestones if the project is more than 1 month long.

Use calendar dates so you take into account unrelated delays, vacations, meetings, and so on. It should look something like this:

Start Date: June 7, 2018
Milestone 1 — New system MVP running in dark-mode: June 28, 2018
Milestone 2 - Retire old system: July 4th, 2018
End Date: Add feature X, Y, Z to new system: July 14th, 2018

Add an [Update] subsection here if the ETA of some of these milestone changes, so the stakeholders can easily see the most up-to-date estimates.

2.7. Testability, Monitoring and Alerting (Optional)
I like including this section, because people often treat this as an afterthought or skip it all together, and it almost always comes back to bite them later when things break, and they have no idea how or why.

2.8. Existing Solution (Optional)
2.9. UX Design (or Changes)
2.10. UI Design (or Changes)
2.11. Deployment and Maintenance
Describes the plan for deploying the system, ongoing maintenance strategies, and upgrade paths.

2.12. Conclusion and Future Work
Finally, summarizes the content of the document and outlines future expansion plans or potential improvements.
